I made this project by learning from Udemy lessons but I saw that teacher's logic was not suit for me, so I changed the game logic and made them as good as I thought as I can.

Controlling
"WASD" for control the avatar

Pick up
Move close to objects and pressed "E" button for pick up items.

Open Inventory
Pressed "I" to open inventory

You can equip, drop, eat (if the item is eatable) items.

Enjoy!!
